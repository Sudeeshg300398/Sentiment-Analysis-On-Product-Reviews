18-04-2019,TheRelatableReviewer,"Portable, Stable, Stylish!","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This travel system is simply amazing. The carseat and base have straightforward instructions, and the installation is a breeze. The zippers for the stroller basket are heavy duty with a stylish metal finish, and the entire system feels very refined. There are no corners cut in regards to quality, and style. This Shyft stroller is definitely lighter, with a narrower wheel base compared to the XPAND stroller. If you are looking for a single child option, the Shyft would be my first choice. The only, and I mean ONLY thing that could be less than A++++ is the height of the stroller handle. It is perfect at my height (5'10"") and my wifes (5'8""), but it may seem a little tall for any one that is shorter in stature. All in all, this Shyft System is downright user-friendly, easy to use, and good looking while doing it. I will definitely be recommending this to my dad friends!!!",2,positive
18-05-2019,Marlanab218,Easy and versatile!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This travel system has so many great features. 1. The car seat base was simple to install and very tight! 2. The stroller basket is huge which makes it possible for me to make a small grocery run without needing a store cart. 3. It's super easy to get the car seat on and off of the stroller which is important especially when you are trying to keep a baby asleep transitioning from the car or vice versa. 4. The toddler seat reclines very smoothly so I can lay the baby down from sitting without disturbing her if I can tell she's getting sleepy. 5. The stroller maneuvers like a dream which I was worried about because of it having two wheels in front. 6. My babe seems very comfortable in both the car seat and toddler seat AND they can face either direction when attached to the stroller! Amazing! 7. The SensorSafe monitor is comforting though the chime it plays when you turn the car off is a little loud and has actually woken the baby once. 8. It's really sleek looking in all black with silver accents! The only two things I don't care for are: 1. When you fold the frame you have to be very careful because the handle comes so close to the ground that I have scraped it a couple times and now the plastic is roughed up. 2. Even though my baby is 5 months, sometimes I like to use the toddler seat for long rides so she can stretch out and see a little more. The problem is that you can't hook the car seat on while the toddler seat is in place like another stroller I have so the car with this travel system has the frame and the toddler seat separate in the trunk. I do it that way so I don't have to take it apart for the more common instances when I am just hooking the car seat on but the two separate takes up quite a bit of space in the trunk. With that being said, I prefer this system to the other I have so the all the great features definitely outweigh the couple cons I have found.",2,positive
20-04-2019,Kiela,So many features with such simplicity!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First i would like to point out that baby #3 is not yet born so this review is for assembly and features only. So first thing is shipping, my product arrived over a week early! Score! Next thing i would like to talk about is assembly. There was no assembly required for the stroller frame itself. The 4 wheels snapped into place in about 30 seconds. Then you just pop the toddler seat or car seat right into place. Next, I love the versatility of this stroller set. You can use either the infant seat or the toddler seat in forward or rear facing positions. You simply push a button on each side, or the release on the back of the infant seat, and spin it around! There are multiple positions for the toddler seat which is great for long trips in the stroller like a day at the zoo. Little one can nap or sit up to see the excitement. The canopy has a zipper extension so you can see baby through the mesh while still protecting them from the sun. One of my favorite features are the brakes. How many moms have scraped the top of their toes trying to lift the brake on their stroller in the summer time? I know I have! There is no lifting on this brake system. Just push forward for brakes and backward to remove the brake. The entire system is very sturdy and durable while also being easy to use and light enough weight. Lastly, the infant seat and base. They are both a little complex in my opinion but i suppose thats what you get for the price you pay. The base has some nice features to it like storage for the Latch Straps and an additional securing mechanism for the seatbelt. Also a gage for the proper recline level as per age of child. The infant seat is padded wonderfully for comfort and comes with very nice infant support pillows! Very thick and supportive. There is a one handed adjuster for the height of the shoulder straps which is amazing! Also a one handed push bottom to adjust the tightness of the straps once buckled. The canopy is very sturdy and the carrying handle is very easy to lift and adjust. The Sensor Safe Chest Clip seems pretty great but I wont know for sure till baby comes. My only complaint so far is that there wasn’t an instruction manual for the infant seat or base. As a mother of soon to be 3 i was able to figure it all out myself but to new parents i could see that being quite intimidating! There are so many rules and regulations in regards to car seats a new parent should definitely have an instruction manual. I still haven’t figured out where to put the extra attachment for the sensor safe system!?",2,positive
17-04-2019,RadMomof3,"Luxurious, Practical, Secure and SAFE.","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The car seat is what you call safety at its finest. The upholstery is cushioned and feels comfortable for a newborn to toddler. I really enjoy the newborn insert. No need to purchase additional inserts! This also has an attached adjustable headrest as well. All can be easily removed and washed incase it gets soiled. EvenFlo has taken safety to the next level with the SensorSafe. This little attachment on the seat belt can monitor infant comfort levels while snapped in. There’s an app that connects to your phone and can be Bluetooth connected to your vehicle. It will alert you if it is too warm, unbuckled, or if baby has not been moving for a period of time. But remember parents this is a car seat safety assistance app, NOT a Baby Sitter so you still need to be a responsible parent! My stroller is marvelous !! So Chic, Stylish and comfortable for my little bubs. You have the option of forward facing or parent facing. Or even to just attach the car seat directly on the frame. It’s all very very easy. There’s recline options for infant comfort and my favorite part out of this is even the foot rest area has adjustment options and the fabric there is coated so if it gets dirty is easily wipable. The storage basket is very ample and easily assesible. The wheels are larger than the average stroller and does well on almost all terrain. I took this to roll over some grass, dirt/rocky roads, bad concrete/asphalt and it was no trouble. I drive a Prius and this doesn’t take up my entire trunk. I stand at 5’1 and the height of the stroller is perfect for me doesn’t not strain my arms or stroller. The height can also be adjusted if you are taller. I adjusted to see how high it can go and it went as high as my forehead lol. I am currently 5 months pregnant with my 3rd and I am able to carry this with out difficulty. This is the best stroller I have!",2,positive
24-05-2019,Anonymous reviewer,Amazing Versatile Travel System,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Evenflo Gold SensorSafe Shyft Travel System is everything I was looking for in a car seat and stroller combination...plus so much more. The ability to easily go from forward facing to rear facing with both the infant and toddler seats is my favorite feature. It only takes seconds! Regardless of where we are or which child needs to ride, this stroller accommodates it all. I can transfer my baby from the car to the stroller without disturbing her. The recline function is great for when my toddler needs a quick nap. The oversized canopy is perfect for protecting my little ones from the elements and the peek-a-boo window not only allows me to keep an eye on my child, but provides air flow as well so they don't overheat. The storage basket underneath is large enough to hold all of our gear for the day when we're out and about. While it doesn't have a parent console with pockets or a place for cups, there is an expandable cup holder that attaches to the side of the stroller. The stroller frame itself is very sturdy and the material is incredibly durable - both important when young children are concerned. Folding the stroller is fairly effortless, just make sure the seat is forward facing. There are individual locks on the rear wheels, easy to activate, even in sandals or flip-flops. I find this system a little easier to push than other brands I have tried. The infant seat has an innovative SensorSafe technology. The chest clip and wireless receiver connect to an app on my phone so that I will receive alerts if the buckle becomes undone or my baby becomes too warm. It also senses if too much time has passed without sensing any movement. The infant seats accommodates babies from 4 to 35 pounds. As my daughter grows, it's very easy to adjust the harness as it never needs to be rethreaded, it simply slides up to grow with her. The base was very easy to install using the Latch system in my vehicle. I was able to do it in less than a minute (while 38 weeks pregnant)! The SecureMax seat not only meets, but exceeds many safety standards. Another important feature - washability. The seat pads are removable and machine washable. Because it's inevitable that spills and accidents are going to happen. I could not be happier with the Evenflo Shyft system.",2,positive
26-05-2019,heatherandrj,This is the best!,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When I first saw the travel system I loved the way that it looked! So sleek and modern! It was incredibly easy to put together. The way the car seat is designed makes it more comfortable for an infant that is growing. It has more of a flat base then a curved. Who would not love the huge basket on the bottom to hold everything you need on your day out. So easy to access too. A huge plus as some can be so hard to get the stuff out. The expanding shade is another huge plus! I love how when my child sleeps they can sleep in an almost laying down position. The car seat is very easy to install into the car. I wish I had this stroller as my very first! Only thing missing is a tray that can hold a cup and snack for the child.,2,positive
20-05-2019,Christinereyes26,Our new travel buddy!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Being a first-time mom is quite challenging. You are always paranoid with things and makes sure all the stuff that you will get for your little one is safe but at the same time budget friendly. One of the staples in having a baby is a travel system. An infant car seat and a stroller to go with it. Not only it is convenient for travel, but also makes parents life easier. In choosing a travel system we always consider a lot of things. We of course prioritize our baby’s safety. We, as moms also consider the materials used, durability and price. Another important thing to consider is how easy for us moms to assemble and install this kind of stuff. I then stumble to Evenflo Gold Shyft travel system. It is like a gift sent by the heavens for me. I am not a tech savvy person and I admit that I am not the brightest when it comes to building and installing things. But this travel system changed everything. It was very easy to assemble. I love the different options for the stroller, and it is not difficult to change the positions and adjust the angles of the basket itself base on my baby’s needs. The rear wheels are a bit chunky for me, but it became ok after I felt the smoothness and ease to push the stroller. Whenever my 10-month-old is in a stroller he likes to see all the things around him and the option of the bassinet itself being able to adjust from lying down to straight sitting position is a big plus for me. He loves how high he is and how we can angle him base on his comfort. The sensor safe feature is very easy to use. I can detect if my is feeling hot or too cold. I love that I can monitor him using my phone. I am very happy with the design and feel of the material. It is very breathable and fashion forward. The color choices are so nice but I just prefer this onyx black since it can go with everything with my baby’s outfit. The car seat and stroller design is sleek and has a beautiful black metallic shine to it. There is also a zipper where you can leave it zipped or opened so you can see your child while the sun is out without the sun getting into your babies eyes and also for added air flow so your baby doesn't get hot. The brakes on the stroller are so easy to use you just push forward to brake and backwards to remove the brake. The stroller itself is light weight which is very important when traveling and it is very easy to fold and unfold. Overall, I am very happy with this stroller and I would recommend it to all parents out there.",2,positive
19-04-2019,motherhoodisbeautiful,"Smooth ride, aesthetically pleasing, made well.","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very comparable to the uppababy stroller. It is so well made and such a smooth ride. Very quick assembly too. The seat clicks onto the stroller frame so well and removes just as easily. You can collapse the stroller easily by pulling upwards. You might need to take off the seat to get it to fit more compact but it fits very nicely in the car. I love the huge storage basket on the bottom, it’s perfect for packing up for the park, shopping, and even grocery store trips. The color of this is very beautiful, not just a solid black. I do also love how the car seat lights up when clicked correctly. This travel system is amazing!",2,positive
18-04-2019,KLMR4023,Amazing product!!!!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is sleek and stylish perfect for and on the move mom with little time to sit and fuss with a car seat and re threading it over and over again. The slide adjusted car seat is amazing and so incredible. Prefect fit every time.this stroller was easy to put together. Not husband or instructions required at all just a fey snaps and it’s ready to go. I love the possibilities on this as well from infant all the way sky back fro the toddler naps to siting up and active baby ready to see the world. My little one love this feature already!!! Busy family always in the go so this all being easy to instal, light weight, and easy to install make this a life and time savor that I get to spend more time with my kids not fighting with little things that are supposed to keep them safe. It is amazing and easy couldn’t be happier with this product or is beauty and solid design. I’m in love!!! You will be too.",2,positive
11-07-2021,DeborahJ,Great product for both mom and baby,"This travel system is ideal for transporting my son. As a single mom in my 40s by choice, I need systems in place that both make my life easier and make my son's life better. The Evenflo Shyft system does both. The pieces are high quality and very easy for me to use. My elderly parents were also able to acclimate quite quickly. The componant parts are made with my child's safety and comfort in mind. Appropriate technology and cushions protect his body,but the way they fit also protects him from sharp edges (and thus my ears from complaints). A really top notch product from a great comany with quick, helpful support. The cat also approves.",2,positive
21-05-2019,DarthDamsel16,Spectacular travel system,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have to say that they have outdone themselves with this travel system, it is stylish and sleek while being safe, secure, and multifunctional. The stroller it’s self is so great and it is a modular and can be used in many different ways including bassinet style and if you have two babies or one small baby and a young toddler you can put the car seat on the stroller and still use the seat for the older child! This thing is great, I keep finding new little things I love about it! The car seat is so snug, and extra cushioned for you little ones comfort and protection. One of the innovative things about this system is the car seat has safe secure which is a system that alerts you when your car turns off that your baby is still in the car. So this system works through a sensor type operation in the chest clip that communicates with a small piece that plugs into your car under neath your steering wheel, this to me is ingenious considering there have been times that people have forgotten their babies. The husband finds it a bit annoying but I think it’s great and you can never be to safe. All in all this travel system is stellar and well worth your money and I feel safer having it! By far the best travel system I have had to date.",2,positive
24-04-2019,AshleyL,Amazing Travel System!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you are looking for an amazing travel system look no further. This stroller/car seat combo has everything you need to get your little one around easily and safe. First, let's start with the set up. It was super easy, the stroller was completely set up except for the wheels and all you had to do was push them right on and they clicked. Also, the car seat and toddler seat click on the stroller very easily no more fighting with the frame involved. The stroller has so many amazing options on how you may want your child to face while going places. The car seat and stroller design is sleek and has a beautiful black metallic shine to it. There is also a zipper where you can leave it zipped or opened so you can see your child while the sun is out without the sun getting into your babies eyes and also for added air flow so your baby doesn't get hot. The brakes on the stroller are so easy to use you just push forward to brake and backwards to remove the brake. The stroller folds up nicely and is very lightweight, no more breaking your back to bring it somewhere. The basket has so much room for you to put a diaper bag in and some other essentials. The car seat is so advanced when it comes to safety. The Sensor Safe Chest Clip helps you to know if your child is too hot or too cold, if they have unbuckled their seat belt and if too much time has went by without any movement. It sends an immediate alert to your phone to let you know for your child's protection. The car seat also has a gage for proper recline level as per age of your child. The car seat is padded wonderfully for added comfort and comes with really nice infant support pillows. No more added cost of getting infant inserts! So all in all, I would recommend this travel system to any and everyone.",2,positive
28-05-2019,RegisBrittany,Excellent quality and features.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This travel system has all of the features I found myself wanting with my first child’s stroller. All of the features and accessories are of the highest quality and works without any hiccups. Car seat: The material is comfortable and even feels padded. The black color is easy to clean and will hide stains well. Adjustment of the straps is extremely easy. There is no unhooking. All you need to do is push a button on the top of the car seat and slide to adjust the height of the shoulder straps. The clip in the center of the chest is actually a sensor that works with another sensor you plug into your car to monitor the temperature inside your car and whether the seat is bucked properly. All buckles on the car seat are easy to use and can be done with just one hand. The base is extremely easy to install and has levels with differing colors to aid you in getting the proper recline based on the child’s weight. It also has a very secure and easy to use way to install the car seat base using a lap belt instead of the latch system. Stroller: The stroller moves very smooth and the brakes are easy to use and secure. The bottom basket of the stroller is very roomy. There are several places on the stroller to attach accessories such as cupholders. The actual stroller portion can be used in many different ways. It can be laid completely back and completely upright and even in between. It could work perfectly for a newborn all the way up to an older toddler. The buckles are secure and easy to use. The stroller included a detachable bumper bar. The stroller sits all the way up so an older child will be able to see everything. You can even face the stroller and car seat both ways when you attach it to the frame. The frame is very easy to fold and does not take up much room when you store it because it is separate from the stroller attachment. We love this stroller and it works very well for our toddler. We will be using this for our second child too! I cannot even think of any features that I would add to this stroller or car seat because they are perfect.,2,positive
24-04-2019,leticiama215,Great Features!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This stroller was wonderful! It is lightweight and runs very smoothly! Feels good for a walk in the park! Not to mention the car seat fits so well with my one year old! My previous car seat is too tight and not spacious for her, unlike the Evenflo one she has much more space and is longer! Thank you so much for this travel system! In the pictures below you can see she is in love with it and so am I!",2,positive
22-04-2019,Hannah28,"Easy to use, very versatile!",[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This stoller/car seat combo is sleek in design and easy to use! The car seat let's baby relax while protecting him. The stroller is easy to maneuver and push. The bottom storage was very large making it easy to store diaper bag and toys. Fold up and store was simple and didn't take up to much room. Great for a family on the go.,2,positive
25-04-2019,MMac85,Sleek and great for my toddler!,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Easy to assemble and great for toddler! This is a great stroller system! We are currently using it for our almost 2 year old. He was so excited as I was assembling it (with ease) and wanted me to have him sit in it right away. He seemed super impressed with the level he was sitting and being so much higher than our usual stroller. The durability is fantastic. We had our soon front facing but I bet he would find it funny to be rear facing and seeing us push him too! We have a trip to Disney coming up and this would be a great travel system to bring with us! My only wish was that it had a tray or cup holder for my son to place his snacks or drink.,2,positive
02-05-2019,Crystal1,Great ride!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love the overall look of this stroller. It's easy to push around in different terrains. The steering is great, very maneuverable. The only thing I don't like about it is the placement of the unlock latch to unfold the stroller. It is easy to fold up and unfold quickly. It doesn't take up a lot of space when it is folded up. It fits nicely in the back of my SUV. I recommended this stroller carseat combo for friends who's having a baby soon. The different positions of the seat is awesome and easy to change if you want to see the baby or have the baby look out you can do it with the baby in the seat it's not difficult at all.",2,positive
13-08-2020,lyss_03,Luxury feel at an affordable price,We just purchased our Evenflo Gold Shyft after looking and researching a variety of different travel systems. In my opinion the features and quality of the materials are comparable to some of the more expensive brands but at a much more affordable price point. The stroller base is incredibly easy to put together and very intuitive to use. The storage basket is large and easy to access as there are no additional bars in the way for bags to get stuck on when removing or placing them. The only thing this stroller doesn't have that could make it better is a telescoping handle to accommodate parents of different heights. Can't wait to start using it once baby arrives.,2,positive
06-05-2019,Tara K,OBSESSED!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The coach is the best! The wheels make the ride sooo smooth. I did try both for infant and toddler. The infant way is great. I also tried it with my toddler and she loved it so much, but i did feel it was a bit too small for her, like not enough room for her head.I tried to loosen straps as much as possible as well, but she will not be in a coach much longer anyway. Back to the infant seat, I felt like it was very safe and the support padding was a great added feature (usually you would have to buy separately as an insert) Super easy to click in and out of base. This is the whole package. I highly recommend!!!!",2,positive
29-04-2019,Newtonmama,Easy to use and looks great,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This car seat and stroller travel system has been amazing since day 1. It was easy to install, and you can even call Evenflo for help to make sure you get the car seat base installed perfectly! They were very helpful. I love how simple it is to add the car seat to the stroller, and the stroller basket is big enough for grocery trips! Huge plus. My 12 month old son loves holding onto the little bar and looking out at everything. I’ve gotten compliments on how nice the stroller looks, too. It is a simple and classic design with lots of special details - cupholder, extendable canopy to keep sun out of the little eyes, flip flop break, etc. Very happy with this product!",2,positive
17-08-2022,NatWH,Excellent!,"We have loved this travel system! It looks so sleek, the stroller base is light and so easy to use! Our son is 6 months old now, so we have started using the “toddler seat” attachment occasionally as well- it is so versatile! The infant seat is cozy for our baby and has added safety features that give us peace of mind. My only complaints- 1.) I wish the wheels were more like bicycle tires instead of the foam/plastic. 2.) There is a screw on the under side of the foam handle that somehow caused the foam to split wide open. I called customer service and they took care of the issue right away! We are so thankful!",2,positive

26-04-2019,Mkim7110,Practical & Convenient Stroller,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Shyft stroller is so practical for everyday use. So easy and so simple to use right out of the box. It has so many configurations and the basket underneath is huge! It solves the dilemma of needing a cart when going shopping (and not knowing where to put the infant car seat). I love that it can recline all the way back for when baby is sleeping. The wheels are pretty good on uneven city sidewalks but my brake did jam a couple times. The car seat could be lighter, I personally prefer the litemax but it’s a decent car seat. All in all, it’s a great, practical stroller and very well priced. Some more luxurious features like leather wrapped handles would help since it’s the GOLD line.",2,positive
29-04-2019,Kate T,All in one!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This all-in-one stroller/car seat works fantastic. Some features to highlight are: easy seat adjuster, extended sun shade with mesh peek through area, a big under carriage (big enough for a good size grocery shopping trip!) and the seat turns around easily. Most strollers that allow you to adjust the seats require you to take the seat out to collapse it, but not this stroller. It’s easy to collapse altogether with one click. This stroller rides and swivels smoothly. The car seat is safe and secure with a sensor for security. My baby fits safe and securely into the car seat. I recommend this product.",2,positive
26-09-2019,NurseAmberRN,"Love, love, love","I just received my new Evenflo Gold SensorSafe Shyft Modular Travel System and within a few minutes and at 9 mos pregnant, I easily put it together. The material in both the car seat and the stroller are so soft and plush, I just know that my baby will love it. And the SensorSafe buckle gives that added piece of mind knowing my baby will be safe when I’m driving and unable to keep a constant eye on her. The stroller is so easy to push, super easy to fold up and is very lightweight. I’m so glad I decided to order this new model, rather than the previous one that I originally planned on purchasing.",2,positive
26-05-2021,ShaunaleeMac,Great stroller,"I really ended up loving this stroller. It’s light weight, like all the positions you can use it in. Folds up pretty small compared to other strollers I have had. Easy to open and snap the pieces in. The basket is fairly large holds everything I need it to. Pushes smooth and turns easy. Love the color. Only thing is the car seat is kinda heavy. I have a big baby do hard to carry him in it",2,positive
27-04-2019,Momof04,Highly recommend,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have a 15, 10, 4, and a baby. Let me just say this carseat and stroller is amazing. The carseat is lightweight and I love the new technology and how it alarms you when the car turns off or the seatbelts on the baby is unbuckled while driving. The material is sturdy and easy to wipe clean with warm water and soap. The seat is slimmer and in my opinion gives baby more leg room. The stroller was so easy to put together and very lightweight and turns and moves easy with one hand. (Bonus for moms with multiple children) the stroller also has a huge under storage area which makes it so much easier to store the diaperbag under it without struggling like I have in the past with other strollers.",2,positive
27-04-2019,Mariah492,Puts my mind at ease!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It was super easy to put together! My niece is 4 months old and not only does all the padding reasure her safety the app allows us to check her comfort level! Which with the weather getting hot is amazing ! The visor is also large enough to cover her completely (while car seat is attached). It’s folds easily to fit into the trunk. The under basket is also large enough to hold a few bags while shopping or a diaper bag. Cons: It is a bit heavy lifting in and out of the trunk. Living in the city the sidewalk in narrow and the tires are bit wide and tend to bump/ get stuck onto railings etc. Overall, I would highly recommend this product for the quality and the safety features included!",2,positive
27-04-2019,Nicki2525,Light weight! Great quality!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The stroller car seat combo is amazing and light weight, it’s very sturdy and the fabric is easy to clean and made of good quality. The sensory safe option is a great add on specially if you live somewhere that it’s hot. I love that the base of the car seat has a indicator that moves to tell you if it is in the correct position. The stroller is easy to fold down and position it anyway you prefer. It has a big space in the bottom to store your diaper bag or any other items. I highly recommended this product it was also super easy to put together!!! Thank you for reading and have a great day!!",2,positive
02-07-2022,chipotliz,Easy to use,"After reviewing multiple stroller and car seat combos I decided to go with the Gold Shyft Smart Modular Travel System. I absolutely love the SensorSafe feature on the car seat. Let’s you know temperature in the car, when buckle is clipped and I clipped, if baby has been in the car seat too long and when your phone is too far away from the car seat (aka you left baby in the car). The stroller seat seems to be comfortable for my LO. She falls asleep and always looks comfortable my only complaint is the sunshade. Does not go out far enough so you have to be mindful of where the sun is heating or use a blanket for the brief moments sun is hitting the baby. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase.",2,positive
26-05-2021,SierraB,LOVE,We got the evenfloGOLD SHYFT stroller/infant seat combo. Assembly was so easy even at 37+ weeks pregnant. We love the durability of this stroller while still having good maneuverability. The wheels are perfect for our country living too. Super cute color for our son in Sapphire and love all ways he can use it til he’s older. Highly recommended!,2,positive
17-08-2020,nicki4799,Lightweight and easy to put together,"The stroller I purchased for my first child, took time to assemble. This one was a breeze! My 3 year old helped me click on the tires and that was pretty much it! I even tested out the toddler seat with her around the house and she loved it! This will be perfect for my newborn next month. I love that the toddler seat can be removed and the carseat placed on its own. This keeps the stroller light. I'm the one that has to carry it in/out of the car trunk every time, so the lighter the better. It's also not bulky looking and folds down so small that I will have so much extra trunk space now!",2,positive
02-07-2021,AlisaC,From screaming to crying to silence and looking out the window,I had the evenflo pivot expand and upgraded to this one since my 3 year old is to big for the second seat. My newborn would scream and cry every time we put him in the car seat and the whole ride we went anywhere! Today was the first time we used the shyft and he hasn’t cried once! He seems move comfortable and padded in this car seat!,2,positive
30-07-2022,Beautyy,It’s like a 2 for 1 ‼️‼️‼️ A new mom BFF,BEYOND 5 stars. It’s very easy to use. My favorite part is the SensorSafe… it’s soooo accurate. I also love how easy it is to close the carrier. You literally just have to push down and it close. BUT TO BE HONEST I WAS already sold from the color. (Grey &Pink) not only do it look fabulous it’s all around a good stroller and car seat.,2,positive
13-07-2019,ZeroMG,Smooth as can be!,"This system is so innovative and great! Gone are the days of bulky stroller and car seats. I really wish this product was around when I had my first child 8 years ago. The material is of high quality and i can see why it is a tad more expensive than basic systems. You really do get what you pay for with this one, on a positive note! My son was born a bit earlier than expected and we will have to quarantine him for the time being but we sure are excited to be going places with this system. So far we have only tried it out around the house, but I can already tell how awesome it's going to be on our future adventures! Currently saving up for the convertible car seat due to the great quality of this system!",2,positive
18-04-2019,Kate4023,Not enough words!!! WOW!!!,There are not enough words for this product safety is amazing and a feature that is out done. The best part of this travel system was not the sensor although that adds more peace of mind. The stroller is amazing with all it’s options for the car seat the baby baby all they up to the toddler. It’s amazing. More than anything the one thing I have always wanted in a car seat for a baby was the slide adjusted systems to make sure it fit just right and made life easier. Well they have done it. It’s amazing. And I couldn’t be happier with this product. I love it and you will too!!!!,2,positive
30-09-2021,Tamera,Great quality,Love this travel system! It’s so easy to use and great quality! The sensor safe technology gives me piece of mind while driving with my infant in the car. It’s a bit pricey I have no complaints so I guess it was worth it,2,positive
25-08-2020,Anonymous reviewer,Slick and stylish,"I have now been using my Shyft for 3 months. I can honestly say we really like the easy open and folding and the fact we can attach the car seat right into the stroller. It’s a smooth push, and my child seems to be very comfortable in it. He does get some of his longest sleeps while in his car seat. However, I wish there was a command centre to hold my wallet, keys, phone, etc. I had to purchase a third party command centre to attach to the handles. I also found that the cup holder attachment was fairly flimsy and I couldn’t even keep a water bottle in it while walking.",2,positive
08-11-2019,Mamapa,Great features and easy to maneuver!,Very stylish stroller. Bassinet converts to a seat with just a click under seat. I love the multiple positions this stroller offers.The basket is very spacious. It’s not bulky like other strollers on the market. Easy to fold and won’t take up much space. car seat is nicely padded and easy to remove from car seat base with just a click. Having sensor safe In car seat is another great safety feature that gives me peace of mind. Comes with never flat tires and easy foot brakes. If you’re in the market for a reliable stroller with a great price point this stroller is for you!,2,positive
24-05-2019,martyhdz,Very Stylish and Elegant!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First of all, the stroller looks so stylish and the quality rivals those of the more expensive brands. It handles well and I think the height is just right. I am 5ft tall and I don't feel overpowered by the stroller. The basket is spacious enough to hold your diaper bag and a few extras. The stroller recline feature is very easy to use and the break is also easy to flip on and off. Cons: the carrier is heavy you need to use both hands to move the handle forwards and backwards the stroller is not expandable, this is reason I don't think it is a good value for my family",2,positive
28-06-2021,Victoriab,Love it,"This stroller is beautiful I haven’t fully set it up yet but for the most part it’s definitely stylish. I love the car seat lots of padding , looks very safe for my baby as well.",2,positive
26-05-2021,gloriac,THE ONLY STROLLER YOU’LL NEED!,We recently purchased this travel system and are very impressed overall. From box to sidewalk it may have taken 10 min. A few clicks and it was ready to go. The base for the car is extremely sturdy and we have no hesitation about our sons safety. The material is very soft and seems quite comfortable for the little guy. It’s very smooth to push and the wheels are a softer material which absorbs a lot of the bumps along the way. It’s a very versatile product from infant up to toddler with multiple variations. It’s an affordable system with safety first. Highly recommend!!,2,positive
26-05-2021,MelisaM,Best stroller / car seat ever!!,Amazing I love this stroller and car seat so much! It’s save with the sensor I always know when my baby is clipped in secured and is everything every new mom would want!,2,positive
27-04-2019,WFJones,In love!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my favorite car seat/stroller combo I have ever used or encountered. The stroller was so easy to put together, and it just glides! the stroller and car seat are very attractive, and comfortable. The stroller has so much space underneath for storage. There was room for my diaper bag, my purse, my sister’s purse, and there was still room. I would have preferred a better cup holder, when we went over bumps or breaks in the sidewalk it would rock back and forth and almost my cup would fall out. It wouldn’t probably be an issue if I had a smaller drinking container. Love the smart clip feature on the car seat, and all of the balancing features for the base. This is a car seat that will give you full peace of mind.",2,positive
25-03-2020,Damiano,"VERY LIGHT, VERY WELL MADE, SMOOTH FEEL","After lots of review reading, we decided to get this travel system for our first born. Wow am I glad we did. After seeing and using all my friends' travel systems, I can see immediately this is a very well made and very nicely designed system that is LIGHT when compared to other makes. Even my friends wished they had gotten this system as it is so easy to move, convert from one stage to another and lift. The versatility of the system is great as well and the step by step instructions on how to install the base in your car is a breeze. Highly recommend this to anyone.",2,positive
30-04-2019,Punki,RoboStroller,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I thought I'd seen everything until i got this stroller/carseat for my grandson. My hands aren't as strong as they once where and I have trouble getting him latched in. Now that I have this latch sensor I have the confidence and peace of mind that he's in securely every time. It has thick straps that don't get twisted up. The seat itself is extremely lightweight and easy to attach to the stroller. Everything about it is easy and helps relieve the stress of going out with our beautiful baby boy. We feel safe and he loves it too. The stroller is so well made it will glide over any surface with ease even sand. You definitely get what you pay for here. It's the Cadillac of car sest/strollers. We're extremely happy with it.,2,positive
15-04-2022,KelseyB,MUST HAVE!,The car seat is so nice and top quality as well as the stroller and toddler attachment. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!,2,positive
21-12-2019,Becca11,Beautiful design and function,"I received this stroller when I accidentally ordered it instead of the expand. I set it up and used it inside our home only when I realized it was the wrong stroller. I fell in love with it and contemplated keeping it until the new expand came in and I was able to see them side by side. This shyft is a wonderful stroller Nd if it wasn’t my need to two seats in a moments notice I would totally have kept it. It’s very sturdy, great functionality, clean lines and the most easy set up of any stroller ever. I highly recommend it if you don’t need two seats on occasion.",2,positive
06-09-2021,AlietteP,Love the set,"Very good, we loved this set. Everything we need for the new born. Disclaimer: We haven't used it yet",2,positive

08-06-2020,giftreceiver,It's not bad!,"This travel system was purchased for me as a gift and it is just okay. The materials used are pretty nice, but I find the canopy on the carseat very flimsy. the canopy on the bassinet part is much sturdier and nicer. The stroller is a nice smooth stroller if you exclusively use it on smooth pavement or inside stores. It is not good at maneuvering through snow, sand or gravel. It's also a very bumpy ride even over sidewalk cracks. It does fold nicely, but it's not a one-handed fold/unfold. Overall it is not what I would have picked for myself, but its just alright",2,positive
16-09-2021,Felix,Great investment,"Easy and quick set up, very portable, looks sleek, lightweight, easy to fold and store.",2,positive
08-06-2019,Kededra,Great ride,"I love this travel system I really do. I have tried different travel system and none compares to this one. Smooth ride and the car seat doesn’t move too much in the car so it’s safe for my baby. I wouldn’t recommend another travel system. The material is sturdy yet really soft for my baby. The design is so cute, it’s easy assemble and easy to put in the car doesn’t take up too much space I would buy this exact car seat 10X over. Yes I would recommend if you’re looking for a long lasting and comfortable travel system for your baby you won’t be disappointed.",2,positive
03-10-2020,Chandelle,Awesome Travel System!,"We purchased this travel system a few months ago for our baby on the way. We installed the carseat today, which was very simple and took no time at all. We also put together the stroller and tried out all the different positions for the toddler seat. The stroller seems to have a very smooth ride and moves easily. Haven't used the sensor system yet as we have not had our baby yet, but I'm looking forward to trying it out. It's one of the features I was most excited for in this travel system. Can't wait to use it for our newborn! Very happy with the product!",2,positive
29-09-2020,sta91,Absolutely amazing!!,"I have used our Shyft stroller system for over a month now, and as a first time mom I feel confident when using my stroller & car seat. Driving with my son was very scary, but with the added feature of the chest clip letting me know my son was safe while driving made me feel at ease. The car seat is easy to install, light to use and very easy to take in/out of my vehicle. The stroller is light and effortless to assemble, and when walking it is very sturdy & smooth. I have recommended this stroller to my other first time moms! Exceeded all my expectations!",2,positive
22-04-2019,RosesMom,Simply Amazing!!!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a mom of 4, I am completely in love with this stroller! I have been a mom for 9 years and I can confidently say that this is my favorite stroller set by far. Assembly was fast and easy. I love that fact that this stroller provides multiple seat options from infancy through toddlerhood. Each mode is so simple to change and as parents we know how important simplicity is. For a travel system, this stroller is so light in comparison to many of the strollers I have used in the past. I can easily carry my daughter in one arm while carrying the stroller in the other arm when getting in and out of the house. The stroller folds and unfolds so easily. My husband is 6 ft 2 in. and I am 5 ft 3 in. and we are both able to comfortably push the stroller around. The storage basket underneath is a great size is doesn't seem flimsy which is a big plus. I also like that there is plenty of space between the basket and the ground and I don't have to worry about the basket getting destroyed while pushing the stroller. I do not drive so a good, sturdy stroller is extremely important and this stroller is just awesome. It provides such a smooth ride even on very rocky terrain and has such great steering, which is something my previous stroller was very badly lacking. I fully recommend this travel system to anyone in the market for a stroller and carseat!",2,positive
22-09-2020,DavMcM,VERY Excited to use.,"I assembled this yesterday evening and it was the easiest thing to do. Honestly took about 90 seconds. It looks sleek, it rolls smooth, plenty of storage, the cup holder will fit a Yeti, and the folding function is exceptionally simple. Haven't yet installed the car seat (we're not due for few months) but I'll imagine that's pretty simple, also. Car seat is light, but feels robust. Very happy with the EvenFlo Gold even after handling UppaBaby, Nuna, Bugaboo, and other overpriced rocket ships purchased for either vanity or to 'keep up with the Joneses'",2,positive
20-10-2021,ShannonA,Easy to use!,"As a first time mom, I did a lot of research on which travel system to buy for my baby and I'm so happy I bought this one! It is so easy to use! I love the functionality, design and safety features. I am 5 ft and I find this travel system very easy to maneuver between the six different modes, as well as collapse and stow in my trunk. The SensorSafe technology is unlike any other I've seen in the market! I also love how high up the baby and toddler seat sit on the stroller frame and there is plenty of storage. I am really happy I bought this product.",2,positive
22-04-2019,Sarah0885,So Versatile,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This travel system is lightweight and easy to manage. I love that it's versatile and allows for different positioning for the baby. Only thing that makes it hard with the stroller is the handle. Trying to get the baby in and out without him being in the car seat is a little hard. Overall I really love this travel system. It's more compact when folded than my previous stroller and it's easy to use. The app for the car seat is an amazing feature. I am beyond happy with this travel system and car seat. I love all the different possibilities it allows.,2,positive
29-04-2019,Pashafruit1228,Love the features,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When i open the box i immediately fell in love, it’s so nice and looks very comfortable.. i like that the stroller can switch around so when my son is upset he can watch me while I’m taking my walk or just shopping my friends have asked me where did i get the stroller from and are currently trying to purchase thier own for their bundle of joy. We have a piece of mine with the sensor safe app that send alerts to your phone if anything happens to your baby i will definitely be passing this down to the next baby.. this combo is a must buy!!",2,positive
20-06-2020,Ellebelle,Enjoying my stroller,"I have a toddler and am expecting In August. I was looking for a stroller that carried both my kids, but that didn’t look bulky or have many adapters. I love this stroller, no adapters and comes with the car seat so I no longer have to find one that is compatible or buy extra things to fit it in. I love that i can convert the stroller from double to single so when my toddler outgrows the seat I can easily have a single stroller again. Definitely worth the money. I like the sensor as well, keeps my mind sane. I would recommend it.",2,positive
26-03-2020,JennH1989,Excellent Customer Service!,"My husband and I purchased this travel system for our child in July and we’ve had nothing but a great experience since. The car seat is easy to carry around and comes off the base and stroller with ease. We just started using the stroller attachment and our son seems to be quite comfortable in it. We had an issue with a piece breaking off during air travel (it was the airline company’s fault), but evenflo dealt with us quickly and efficiently to make sure our system was back in shape! The lifetime warranty really is a life saver.",2,positive
07-04-2020,Vicky186,"Stylish, easy to maneuver and super high quality","We weren't able to go out and physically try out strollers due to COVID-19 so we diligently read reviews and looked at all of the options available to us. We ended up feeling like the Evenflo Gold Shyft Smart TS was a good fit for us and we are so happy with our choice! it is so easy to put together and switch out the different settings, its absolutely GORGEOUS and it feels and looks super high quality. On top of everything else, and most importantly, it has great safety features. We would definitely recommend this product!",2,positive
05-07-2020,Matthew,Can't wait to try it!,"After a long search for a stroller we finally landed on the Evenflow Gold - Shyft. We have not had a chance to try it out yet (only a few weeks to go) but we are excited to be able to use this. The Shyft looks good and comparable to more expensive travel systems, and will certainly meet the needs of our future family. The base was easy to install in the car and the car seat clips in/out fairly easy, only complaint is the handle can get in the way. Will try and remember to update my review once we have used it more.",2,positive
08-06-2020,Baviles12,Great stroller,Being a first time mom i was very confused on what i needed and what would be something comfortable and light for me to have since im a very petite person! and let me say this stroller/car seat is worth the money its so convenient and light and easy to get in and out the car and not bulky at all like other strolled and it fits perfect in the trunk of my car! Also the sensor that comes within the car seat is pretty cool! I recommend this evenflo gold shyft to a first time mom or even if you are not a first time mom.,2,positive
22-10-2019,BDasent,5 STAR PRODUCT,"I love this product ! I have gifted 2 Evenflo pivot systems, so when I found out I was pregnant I already knew I was going to go with the evenflo brand but after much research I found out about the evenflo gold shyft & I was ecstatic. Not only did I love the design but also as a first time mom having the sensorsafe technology was an added plus. Not only is this product like no other but it is affordable. Not only do I love it but so does my fiancé. He has complemented me so many times for going with this product.",2,positive
03-05-2019,Mackenzim14,Great travel set,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this travel set. It was super easy to put the stroller together, very easy to collapse and change seating positions on as well. The only thing I wish it had that it doesn’t is the parent tray for phone, keys, built in cup holder. It does have a smaller snap on cup holder and a very large storage basket underneath to make up for the lack of the tray. The car seat is amazing. Easy to install with the matches and is slimmer than other infant seats and is able to fit between my 2 toddlers car seats as well.",2,positive
01-06-2020,UllaM,Excellent and easy to use.,"I bought this set a few months ago and I have loved it. it's easy to adjust the carseat and install the base in the car and it's super easy to remove as well when needing to switch cars. I havent been able to use the sensor part though since theres been issues with the app. but other than that it's beautiful, easy to walk and even jog with; it's very smooth. I love the removable seat. makes it easier to put in smaller trunks and just grab the carseat from the car clip on and go! definitely recommend.",2,positive
26-04-2019,Keya28,Amazing travel system,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love the SensorSafe shyft smart modular travel system it is for the everyday travel. It folds up easily and it isn’t heavy to carry. It gives my baby 2 different views wheather it’s facing me or faceing the world. Using the senor app that comes with it is so great for when I can’t remember if I buckeled the care seat or if he’s to hot in the car . Having the car seat adapt to the stroller is great for when I’m on the go. Using the travel system is great for both newborn and toddler for fun trips to the park my baby is comfortable in each position the stroller has to offer laying down flat or siting up. the stroller is easy to clean and has a comfortable surface. This stroller also allows you to add extra covering up for baby when the sun is just to hot in baby’s face,2,positive
01-05-2019,ZachG,"Good stroller, great car seat",[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I will start by saying we love the car seat. I love the technology to help keep an eye on my son while I am driving. I wish the car seat was for bigger children too. It would help with children that are larger and still not talking. I also think it can do wonders for the disabled community as well. The stroller was just ok to me. I prefer the jogging type stroller to the 4 wheeled stroller. I would suggest combining the car seat with a nice jogging stroller and you would have a five star product,2,positive
26-05-2021,Braxtons,Mostly Happy,We are mostly happy with this product so far. It seems like high build quality and everything fits and s and together nicely. My complaints are that the shade doesn't fold up very nicely and makes the handle hard to move around. It's very annoying. The other is that I was fully expecting the base to have a load leg but it did not. That was disappointing since it didn't say anywhere that it would not be included. The handle is also not adjustable and not in the most comfortable position for me @ 5'10''.,2,positive
18-10-2021,MichiganMama,My favorite infant carseat,"Four kids, 4 different infant carseats for them and this has been my favorite. Durable, not to heavy, easy to adjust the straps when baby grows. One feature i cannot speak for is the securemax feature, I never set it up, but I love the idea of it for those who could benefit from it. The only flaw I have seen is the canopy connection keeps cracking, so I feel it could be made differently so its not so thin there, otherwise it has been great for my tiny baby, who left the hospital at just under 6lbs!!",2,positive
30-05-2019,MemereBell,Literally a lifesaver!,"As a new grandmother I was overwhelmed by the choices currently available in baby gear! I am so pleased to have found the Evenflo Shyft. Not only is it providing safety and comfort for my grandson, I am delighted that it is simple to use. I was concerned about managing a bulky, heavy travel system but the Evenflo is easily lifted and maneuvered. And, best of all, it meets every stringent standard that my daughter requires for her baby! Thank you, Evenflo for meeting the needs of our entire family!",2,positive
18-04-2020,Justyna,Great comfort and style!,"I am 7 months pregnant and having to buy a stroller online without seeing it in real life is not an easy task but this was an excellent purchase! I am impressed with the quality fabrics and how easy it was to put it all together. Just 4 clicks for the wheels and click on the stroller seat/car seat. The Evenflo Gold Shyft is light and also easy to fold. My partner and I are also tall and the handle bar is at the perfect height. Overall, a great stroller and we are looking forward to using it soon!",2,positive
03-04-2022,AmazonGirl,Safe and stylish,"We love our Evenflo gold sensor safe stroller and car seat. I love the sensor safe because it alerts me that the straps are not secure or fastened when I drive with my daughter in the car. The wheels on the stroller are able to handle grass, bark, and other things that I need to go over when I go to the park. My daughter looks very comfortable and secure in the car seat. I've had compliments from people walking by on the stylish Sapphire color of the baby seat. I also like that I can have the baby seat face me or face away from me which gives me options. I also love the great customer service of this company. I had an issue with the handle of the car seat and customer service was able to resolve my issue right away and they were very nice. Great company and great product. I highly recommend.",2,positive
14-12-2020,cg2020,Nice features easy to put together,Just received the pivot shyft travel system. Overall look is nice and the ride is smooth. I bought the connector to add my toddler on it for when we are out. Over all its a nice system. I wish it was a little more easier to put away in the trunk without taking apart everything. I also was under the impression it was like the pivot original and went into the bassinet mode which it isn't sadly. I also don't like there is only one cup holder and i had to buy the snack tray separate. The gold system tracker i just started setting up and seems a little complicated with the tracking clip that has to go in your car... I dont like that. They want my location services on at all times and that will drain my battery and also invade privacy. I dont like that. besides that its okay. I wish i loved it more..,2,positive
20-07-2020,Marie527,Easy to use and stylish,"We bought this travel system a few months ago and it is perfect for us. Easy to assemble and we love that baby can face us in both infant mode and toddler. Super easy to take car seat out of car and onto stroller, not too heavy either. The grey is a lovely neutral that matches everything. Easy to steer with larger back wheels, even through park trails. Especially love the HUGE space underneath for diaper bag and purse. Stroller folds down easily and fits in our SUV with room to spare.",2,positive
24-09-2020,MamiYo,Great Stroller!,"When we were stroller shopping for our baby, this stroller immediately caught our attention. The design is very nice and it's pretty slick. We also like how it is not so bulky. Setup is a breeze too! We use it almost everyday in the summer for walking in the park and walking in the mall and we didn't experience any issues. The front wheels of the stroller turns smoothly without a stop, like you don't have to adjust your position just to make a sudden turn. Overall this stroller is a win!",2,positive
24-03-2020,JMadray,Great Product,"Purchased this after searching for quite a long time. Love the Sensor Safe, it gives me peace of mind after i have strapped my little one in. It is very light weight. Two things I would like to see different is if the wheels were not so smooth ( had grips) and if there was the ability for the infant seat to be closer to me, it feels a bit far from the handle. It was quite complex to install, (maybe because I am a first time mom) but having the technician service available is also great",2,positive
21-12-2019,Anonymous reviewer,Ordered Shyft but received Expand,"I ordered 2 Shyft (black and garnet) because my husband wanted his own set for his car and red is his favorite! We were so excited we opened and put the together immediately. But when they came in the garnet set was the expand. It’s out of the box and put together and no chance of getting it back in to return it. My husband is ok with using the expand but even with only 1 seat in it, it’s bigger and harder to push than the Shyft. Just make sure you double check before you open boxes!!",2,positive
12-06-2020,ing123,"Easy to use, lightweight and stylish.","This travel system was the perfect combination of everything we were looking for. It's super easy to use (folding, swapping out car seat for toddler seat etc.), the car seat is lightweight and easy to carry and the overall design is very stylish.

Looking forward to seeing how everything holds up over time.",2,positive
19-10-2019,tgk71392,Sleek and sophisticated!,I received the Gold Shyft for my baby shower. My husband and I love it! We are expecting our 1st baby in December and just knew this travel system was the one we wanted from the get-go! Putting it together was literally as easy as snapping the wheels into the stroller. My whole family is impressed with the sleekness and sophistication of this travel system! SO CHIC! We took it for a stroll around our neighborhood and it maneuvers so well. We can’t wait for the many walks with baby!,2,positive

Easy to set up with clear instructions. The installation was simple as well. My daughter loves the stroller and is very comfortable in it. I cannot wait to use it with my newborn, the secure max carseat is safe and reliable for your precious little cargo. The storage basket is spacious as well. All in all this is an amazing travel system with great features that I would absolutely reccomend to everyone.",2,positive
26-08-2021,Wendy,Good Quality! My daughter loves it!!,"The quality of this stroller is really great. I walk and jog with my daughter almost every single day, she loves it and always fell asleep after walking her a bit. We really like the click sound to show you are attach the car seat right to the base. The only issue is when baby sitting too long in the infant car seat, she gets sweaty easily during the summer time. But overall we love this product and we already recommend our friends and they also buy the same model with us.",2,positive

It run smooth and easily navigated, the car seat is not too heavy just the way I needed it, and it look really luxurious with high quality clothes and smart features, i do love the sensor technology very smart and I cannot feel more confident about my baby being safe and secure. Well made evenflo am really impressed.",2,positive
30-06-2020,Tanya38,Looks smart and lots of convenient features!,"We bought this for our newborn baby and so far it seems great to have a modular system. The car seat is very sturdy which is very important. The stroller also looks very smart and chic (we got it in grey) so overall I'm happy with the purchase. The only drawbacks for me would be that it's a bit on a bigger side and for me as a small person (5.3'), it's a bit hard to fold/change settings. Perhaps it's just because the stroller is still new and we haven't used it that much.",2,positive
23-05-2019,klabate,I Love This Stroller!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been loyal to a different brand for years, but I have to say that I have sold my other strollers as this is the only one that I need. It is light, maneuvers easily, and is roomy yet is small enough to take into smaller stores and restaurants. My favorite feature is the storage space underneath. It is huge! With my other stroller, I always felt as if I had to go on a fishing expedition just to get something out. This stroller I can take stuff in and out with ease.",2,positive
27-04-2019,JZBG24,GREAT SIZE AND STURDY!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently had the Urbini omni, and now using this stroller.. i see similarities but i would definitely prefer the evenflo gold! the wheels are more durable for the outdoor activities i do with my fiancée and daughter! and she LOVES being able to sit up in it and look around, from the first day we put it together she didn’t want to get out. she actually thinks it’s a “ride”! i also love the sensor system and being able to feel even more safe when she’s in the back seat.",2,positive
30-04-2019,Dani07,Great features!,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love how versatial this travel system is for my family. It is very easy to put together and the instructions are easy to read. It has six different features which always it to grow with your baby. This travel system is very well built and sturdy. The infant carseat that comes with it exceded my expectations. It's easy to install and gives you peace of mind in knowing your baby is safe when traveling in this seat. I highly recommend this travel system to every parent!,2,positive
11-04-2020,LindsayB35,"Great price, many features.","I bought this stroller based on other reviews and the fact it had great safety ratings. The price also was very attractive. The set up was amazingly easy and I love how lightweight both the stroller and car seat is. It maneuvers well and feels smooth when I tested it. It folds up compactly enough to fit in my hatchback. Quality is great, features are awesome. I wish it came with a snack tray, hence the 4 stars. I'm excited for baby to arrive so I can put it use.",2,positive
02-05-2019,Carolina28,Overall great!!!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this set!!!! The stroller I was able to use for two of my kids and they were both more than comfortable! It looks great, it was super easy to put together, light and easy to move. My only wish for the stroller is that it would have one front wheel only and be more like a jogging stroller but overall it is GREAT set and I would recommend to all of my friends. I am actually letting a friend borrow it this week while she is deciding what to get for her newborn.",2,positive
18-06-2020,CASSzMSS,Great Versatility!!!,"We would definitely recommend this stroller. Only reason I gave it a 4 is because of the cupholder, it's not very sturdy. Other than that it's great! The SensorSafe technology wasn't something on our wish list - but it's a wonderful added feature to an already great travel system. Looking forward to seeing how everything holds up over time. This travel system was the perfect combination of everything we were looking for. It's super easy to use (folding, swapping out car seat for toddler seat etc.), the car seat is lightweight and easy to carry and the overall design is very stylish. It has a nice smooth ride and isn't bulky at all. Shyft is the best value for the money as it gives the light weight and firm design with good looks. It would be the best if I could remove all covers easily, especially the main stroller.",2,positive
15-06-2021,Wendy,First time mom loves travel system,I obsessed looking for a travel system until my sister-in-law purchased the Gold Shyft in onyx. It's versatile and looks like great quality. I've taken it out myself from the trunk and it's easy to assemble. My son has already soiled the car seat and it was easy to remove and sanitize. My only concern would be that my newborn son easily slipped in the car seat. He met the required weight so I just tried to avoid having him in the car as a newborn.,2,positive
27-04-2019,THarris242612,"Best Travel System, Hands Down!","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This travel system is amazing! The car seat is so easy to carry, and very comfortable. It clicks into the stroller effortlessly. The SensorSafe chest piece alerts you if your child’s buckle isn’t fastened, if your child is too hot, or has been in the car seat too long. The bassinet also clicks into the stroller effortlessly. It has 3 positions, one sitting up and two reclining. I love that you have the choice of using the bassinet or you can just click the car seat into the stroller for a quick trip! The basket underneath the stroller is very spacious! The stroller is very easy to maneuver, even one handed. The design of this travel system is beautiful, and sleek. I have nothing but positive things to say! From quick shopping trips, to grocery shopping, to baseball practices and school pick up this travel system makes everything easier!",2,positive
22-04-2019,Cathy Gardner,Great car seat and stroller combination,"We got this product on Friday and we love how easy it was to put together! The stroller went together in about 10 minutes including the time it took to take off all the packing materials and sort the pieces. It folds and unfolds so easy and changing the position of the seat is so easy and quick! Not at all heavy like our other strollers. We can not wait to use the car seat this June, it is absolutely the best infant seat we have had in our family.",2,positive

12-01-2023,Jennifer J.,Is falling apart after 6 months of very light use,"I ordered this for my daughter and the stroller is falling apart after 6 months of light use. We have 4 strollers total (this one, a travel one, a wagon stroller, and a jogger stroller) so this one is barely used (as we use whichever stroller matches our outing) and the foam around handles has ripped/is peeling off and the back wheel makes weird noises when pushing. For the price, I’m very disappointed in the stroller part of this travel system.",0,negative
28-04-2023,Breana M.,So easy!,"I love this stroller/car seat combo! It was super easy to put together and it isn’t too heavy or bulky. I love the way it glides, even on rough pavement and bumpy grass. The only issue I’ve had with this stroller is that one of the foam handles came off after just a few months. However, I reached out to customer support, and the issue was resolved in less than 5 minutes! Two days later, a new one came in the mail. Great customer service!",2,positive
30-05-2021,MomRN3,Sleek design and ease of use,"After researching several travel systems, we chose this model for its high safety ratings, good reviews, and appealing design. When it arrived it didn't disappoint. Even at 9 months pregnant I was easily able to assemble the stroller in little time. It's easy to convert into different modes and folds nicely for travel or storage. It's also easy to push and handles well. We love the design and the materials look to be high quality.",2,positive
28-08-2019,Jaymed,Super Easy & Great Features!,I was so excited to get the car seat & stroller and when I did I was even more excited! It was so easy to put together and even easier to use. My husband really liked the smoothness of the stroller and how easy it is to maneuver. I love how comfortable the car seat feels and how easy it is to set up in the stroller and on the base. The base requires a lot of security which makes me feel way more comfortable. Overall great product!,2,positive
28-06-2020,Currie20,Easy to use and very safe!,"I bought this car seat and stroller a few months before my son was born after much research. We have been using it for two months now and we absolutely love it. The safety features are great, we are always confident that our little one is buckled in safely and not overheating. The stroller is very easy to collapse and open and it fits great in the trunk of our vehicles. I would definitely recommend this product to others!",2,positive
20-11-2019,Drel,Luxury,"I was so excited when this arrived. After shopping around for almost 2 months for a car seat/stroller combo, we finally decided on Evenflo gold. It is so easy to put together and the safety features are a plus. I took my niece for a ride to test it out, being that the baby hasn't arrived yet and it maneuvers without any difficulty. Having an Evenflo gold is like having a luxury ride. You can't go wrong with this!!!",2,positive
01-05-2019,ShayT19,So much storage!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This stroller has many things to love about it. That being said there were things I didn’t love. Pros: - storage basket is HUGE - easily change between toddler seat, bassinet or infant seat - easy assembly of the stroller - nice easy push - infant car seat is very nicely built and the secure max clip is a nice piece of mind (though it can be difficult to unclip) Cons: - the car seat base was not simple to get installed (lots of reading the manual) - for the price of this stroller I would expect it to ride down the road better (especially when using it with the bassinet you can see it shaking with every bump and uneven road) These are just some of the things I’ve noticed in the short time I’ve owned this system. Overall it is a nice system, that looks and feels high quality. I will return to update my review when I’ve had longer with the product.",2,positive
27-04-2019,Glammommy94,Beautifully designed travel system,I ordered my travel system Monday evening and received it by Friday afternoon. I ordered the Onyx and I must say it is beautiful in person. The stroller set up is easy but I haven’t put my car seat on the base yet or installed it in my car. I haven’t used the stroller with my baby yet but will update my review when I do. I’ve rolled it around my living room and haven’t had any problems with the wheels or anything.,2,positive
14-03-2020,Jackeline,Great product at an excellent price,"We are in love with our new Gold Shyft TS in color opal. Is very sturdy, comfortable, made out of a great material. Color is super beautiful and seems very easy to maintain clean. Have very good space at the bottom. We love the fact that our daughter can grow with it. Carseat and infant basket are very well cushioned, which is a plus and comfortable for babies. Super easy to assemble, easy to closed and open.",2,positive

I also love how versatile it is. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone.",2,positive
08-05-2019,gmathias90,The highest quality travel system for your child!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This travel system is incredible. The stroller is super lightweight and at 5’8” the height of the handlebars are perfect for me. You can put the infant seat in the stroller or have your child just in it either facing forward or towards you. I love that the option is there to switch it without having to use the infant seat itself. This car seat though. It. Is. Incredible. It has two features that I specifically love. The first is the SensorSafe chest clip. It lets you know that your child is buckled in safely, if your baby is too hot/cold, doesn’t move for a long period of time or is still in the car. The app is so easy to use. The second is hooking it into the car. It takes like 2 minutes to install it. With they easy clip you can get the base in there as tight as you can imagine. The car seat is also super cushy and you know your baby is comfortable. Highly recommend!!",2,positive
02-09-2019,Cristina,Overall I’m happy just questioning one thing.,I bought the pink Evenflo Gold Shyft.. overall Its okay just wished there is few things I would of perfected a bit more. When I have the stroller fully opened and the car seat is in place .. the part that bends the stroller has a bit of a wiggle.. so it doesn’t feel 100% secure. Not sure if that is the way it’s suppose to be. I will be contacting the company and see if that is the way it’s suppose to wiggle.,2,positive
26-05-2021,Monroe910,Excellent Stroller Set!!,"I purchased the stroller two days before my delivery.I had no idea I was choosing such a great set it has really great features the car seat and big seat can be switched around. also the sensor safe impresses people when they see it the only thing I don’t like is that I should have chosen a different colour and that there is no front tray, feeding tray or handlebar tray. I highly recommend this stroller set.",2,positive
18-04-2020,GCON,"Easy to fold, light weight, comfortable","I bought the evenflo gold shift in moonstone 2 weeks before baby is due and am so impressed with the quality of the stroller for such a reasonable price! Takes two seconds to fold and even less time to open, living up 3 story walk up I find it easy and light weight to bring upstairs. Comfortable grips on the handles as well as the car seat. Loving the safety features as well as the big wheels. 100% recommend",2,positive
12-11-2019,Kal82,"So far, so good","Baby arrives next month. For the set being “gold” and superior to what we can find alternatively from Evenflo in stores and from other retailers online, I don’t see much that stands out. Fabric is average and the look is average in my opinion. I guess you’re really paying for the sensor safe feature. Rides smooth and I like the adaptability from stroller to car seat to stroller seat with just a click.",2,positive
19-04-2019,Bjones55,So safe and easy to use,"This system is sleek and easy to handle. It has so many safety features that help us feel confident as first time parents. It is extremely easy to use for us as well as grandparents who have helped watch the baby. It even has a cup holder which may seem like a small detail but is really helpful to keep your hands free. I would suggest this carrier system to any parent, expecting parent, or as a gift.",2,positive
09-02-2022,SafinaK,Highly recommended,"As first time parents, We love this set! The SensorSafe feature is amazing and provides a peace of mind when traveling ensures baby is safe. Easy to move the headrest as baby grows. Sometimes the belt sticks but not a huge deal. We also love how it’s not bulky when folding the stroller to put in the car. Both the car seat and toddler seat are separate, not attached to the stroller. Highly recommend.",2,positive
26-05-2021,MelanieF,Very Easy to Assemble!,"This travel system was purchased by my husband and I for our third child. We wanted something with soft fabric that was going to be easy for travel. Out of the box this system took me five minutes to put together. I love how easy the stroller can be changed. Very simple compared to other strollers we have had in the past. However, the base did not come with the load leg as the description entailed.",2,positive
26-04-2019,Anabella92,Excellent Travel System!!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We wanted to wait about a week before writing a review. We were so excited to get the box dropped off at our doorstep. The shipping was really fast! As soon as we pulled the stroller out of the box, we knew we were going to enjoy pushing this thing around. The back wheels are a little wide but it's nothing that can't be overcome. The assembly was easy and instructions were clear. It's really nice that you can move the toddler seat around in different positions. The car seat is nice and padded and provides really good head/neck support. The car seat is pretty easy to install. The sensorsafe buckle is really neat and an excellent safety feature! It's easy to setup following the instructions. Overall we are really happy with this car seat/stroller combo! I definitely recommend this travel system. Very easy to use, maneuver and the sensorsafe buckle is a great addition to keep our kids safe!",2,positive

The wheels glide very nicely and the undercarriage is huge. This is everything I was looking for and more.",2,positive
23-12-2019,CHolcomb,Great customer service and high quality!,"I went back and forth between so many different travel systems and ultimately decided on the Evenflo Gold and I’m so glad I did! Our baby is not here yet so I can’t review using the system or car seat with here but from what I see I’m very pleased! The main factor in selecting the Gold brand was because of the load leg that comes with the infant car seat base. I really wanted that feature but couldn’t pay the high prices that other seats with this feature cost. The car seat is made of high quality, soft fabric and looks very upscale. The stroller system is light and easily collapses. The toddler seat that comes with the stroller is also extremely nice to have. We can’t wait to put it to the test when our daughter arrives! You also can’t beat the added benefit of having Sensor Safe. I’m hoping it works as well as it says! Also, to add each time Ive spoken with customer service they have been great!",2,positive

14-09-2021,NicholasG,"Very happy with the Lyft stroller and the Infant car seat. Easy to use, good quality, and aesthetically pleasing","Really happy with the Shyft stroller and the infant car seat. My child is only a few weeks old so I haven’t used the toddler seat for the stroller yet but I’ve used the infant seat on the stroller and in the car. The quality of the product is nice and it is very easy to use. It took some time to figure out how to adjust the buckle of the infant seat but following the manual made it less challenging. The product is easy to maneuver; the infant car seat can be easily removed from the car base and the stroller while the baby is attached. The toddler seat has many adjustments and each is easy to do. The stroller moves smoothly and going for walks are enjoyable. I haven’t had a chance to try SensorSafe because my car doesn’t have an OBD port. Evenflo was very supportive, gave me a few options and shipped me the SensorSafe 3 using Bluetooth. It took a while to arrive but I finally got it and will attach it to the car seat.",2,positive

18-06-2020,Amanda783,Obsessed!!,When my friend had a baby she got this stroller and as soon as I pushed it the first time I knew that this is the one that I would want when I got pregnant. Turns out six months later I find out that I’m pregnant and now I have this stroller and I couldn’t be happier. It is so light weight and feels so secure and safe.,2,positive
15-06-2021,VinceS,Great Travel System,"We love this travel system for our baby boy. It is super comfy for him. Very lightweight and has all the features you could want in a travel system. We bought another Evenflo system before this Gold Shyft one and it seemed to be harder to get in and out of our car, but when we got the gold system it is simple and easy!",2,positive
11-09-2020,ohsoquiet,Easy and convenient,My mother bought this for me and so far we have been very pleased. The car installation was easy and the car seat/stroller base snap on and off very easily. The mobility has been great too. Also like the sleek look of the grey stroller. The only downside is our car is too old to use the sensor safe feature for now.,2,positive
02-09-2021,Dennis,We love love love it,We got this travel set to replace one we had for our great grandson. We love it the car seat is extremely easy to install in the car its not as difficult to carry as the other one was on the market today. We love how easy the stroller is to open and close. the stroller breaks down so that you can store it in the car.,2,positive
13-09-2021,TommiE,Not great fabrication,"The only reason I gave a 4 star was due to the padding on the seat and stroller being too abrasive for my baby. I wish they would reconsider the fabrication they use. Also the car seat is recommend for 4lbs or larger and my baby was 4lbs 4oz and fit very uncomfortably The stroller is a smooth ride, not too cumbersome",2,positive
28-06-2021,Alyssa,"Super functional, sleek & easy to use travel system!","First baby and I couldn’t be happier with this travel system!

I love that it has the functionality and features of strollers 3x it's cost. It's lightweight, easy to fold and unfold, great maneuverability, sleek modern look, and I love the various seat configurations and car seat compatibility.",2,positive
14-05-2020,CatherineD,Perfect size for city living!,I have had this stroller for five months now and it’s great! It is light and compact. I have a smaller car and I can easily fit this stroller. I live in an apartment and getting on and off the elevator is no problem. We go daily on two hour walks and have found this stroller very sturdy. I highly recommend it.,2,positive
13-12-2019,Ladylira,Easy to handle,My parents bought me this product for my baby shower and I love it. The height is perfect and most importantly is light and super safe. I love the material and my baby does as well. I love that all I need is the stroller base and the car seat to get around with my baby. It’s a great travel system. I love it .,2,positive
29-04-2020,SweetBean,Stylish && Safe!!!,I lovvveeeee my Shyft Gold Travel System. It’s everything I wanted and more. I took my time researching travel systems and this one is by far the best one. I haven’t had any issues with my travel system. The wheels don’t lock or click. And it is easy to manage. Can’t wait to buy the seat when she turns one.,2,positive
26-07-2019,VivaciousWish,Great features & Easy to Install,"So we are first time parents and have no clue about strollers or car seats. After all the research and reading we finalized on Evenflo Shyft. The delivery was on time and packing was great. Instructions were pretty clear for installation and I loved the fact that their is an online appointment schedule setup provided if someone needs. Me being pregnant and my hubs also having no clue on installation, I would say it was pretty easy to do setup. Took us barely 10 -15 mins. Coming to the look and quality. I loved the color we picked. Design is neat and the stroller is not crazy heavy. Car seat looks sturdy and the ease to fix the toddler seat/car seat is fabulous. Looks pretty classic. Fabric is nice and does not look cheap at all. I gave 4 stars as The Cup Holder looks little defective. I am able to keep the glass in it but after little pushing and bending. Well not a big issue but would love if it gets replaced :) More updates I will do on review once Baby is delivered :)",2,positive
23-09-2022,lindseyh130,Good stroller,"We really like this stroller so far. I like how the car seat clicks in for easy use in and out of the car when you need the stroller. And when you aren’t using the car seat, and just want to go for a walk, the other seat is handy to just strap baby in and go. No fuss with the car seat just to go for a walk",2,positive
16-08-2020,Vilma07,Light and easy to install,"I bought this a few weeks ago and I love it!the stroller is very light weight and easy to open and stored away. Space saver, fits perfect in my car trunk! The fabric material is high quality! Love the car seat also easy to install lighted that other car seats brands and it’s just a click into the stroller!",2,positive
13-08-2021,ConnorD,Fantastic car seat and stroller combo,"Wonderful seat, does a perfect job of both protecting our baby and keeping her comfortable. She falls asleep instantly when we hook her up. The seat comes in and out easily but locks in tight. Takes some upper body strength to really make sure everything is together, but the peace of mind is worth it 100%",2,positive
07-10-2020,Abbie007,Great look and features!,"We bought this product last year and we have been very happy with the purchase. It has a sleek and very well thought of design. My baby has recently moved from the baby carrier to the stroller mode and she has been comfortable and happy in both. We loved that it is very versatile and easy to use, too.",2,positive
05-02-2020,Consuelo,Great Stroller,The delivery experience was horrible... Fed Ex was horrible however when I called evenflo they sent a replacement right away. The stoller was very easy to assemble and the car seat is great. The color was exactly what i expected. The stroller is a little on the heavy and bulky side but overall its great.,2,positive
16-09-2019,Jackie27,Magnificent for a Modern Mom,We are having our first in November and were gifted the Shyft Smart Modular Travel System from my parents.

14-07-2020,Paddingtonk,Great customer service!!!,I ordered the pivot xpand and received the shyft instead. I called customer service and they are sending the correct stroller. They were fantastic!! I had opened the shyft so I figured I would review it. The garnet is gorgeous and the stroller is light and rolls very well. Shipped in 3 days!!!!,2,positive
07-04-2020,Parth,Great Travel System,We tried the stroller in Babbies R Us and liked how lite and easy to maneuver. Very impressed with the build quality of the stroller. Immediatly decided to buy it. No doubts. Stroller takes less than 10 minutes to setup out of the box. Getting the box inside a small car took longer than that.,2,positive
06-06-2020,JessGarden,Love our shyft,"We purchased this travel system for our first baby, expected to arrive at the beginning of September. The stroller was very simple to assemble, appears excellent quality and we are so excited for our little boy to arrive so we can use it. It’s a very attractive, lightweight stroller system!",2,positive
02-05-2019,Sml88,Great features for a mid priced stroller!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Till now I've been using the Vista by Uppa Baby so that's what I will compare this stroller to. I feel like all the features that I love about the Uppa Baby I am receiving in this stroller for about 1/2 the price! Let's start with the ease of assembly and use. You literally just have to click the wheels in and your good to go, select the car seat or infant seat and your out the door. Both seats can be used forward facing or parent facing which is amazing. The car seat is light enough that it can be lifted out of the car and attached to the stroller, or vice versa with relative ease. Then there's the size of the basket and accessibility, the basket is big enough to store everything you'd need for a day out and it isn't blocked by the seat which means easy to reach to. Evenflo has put alot of thought in to this stroller making it comfortable for both baby and parent, with extra plush inserts for new borns and extra safety features for parents this is an excellent stylish well priced stroller!",2,positive
27-04-2019,Smiths19,Fantastic product!!!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My wife and I are extremely pleased with this product! It has made our day to day lives so much easier. From shopping to leisure activities on or off pavement this system is the way to go and handles and pushes great! The car seat clicks in and out of the stroller and car base so easily! Do your back a favor and buy this product, don’t kill your self carrying your baby in the car seat just unfold the stroller click the car seat in and go! My son loves it, I don’t have to get him out of his car seat and move him to the stroller ( unless I’m using the bassinet option) and he gets to stay sound asleep! I would honestly recommend this product to anybody and would buy it 100 times over. Between the quality and simplicity to the beyond outstanding GOLD treatment through customer service, this has met all of our expectations and then kept going to completely blow us away! Evenflo has taken care of my growing family and I and I will continue to buy all the great products they have to offer as I need them!",2,positive
28-06-2021,VictoriaE,,"Love the easy installation! Took about 20 minutes max, smooth ride and really easy maneuver. Also love the space in the bassinet mode.

28-06-2021,NatalieD,,This was a gift from my coworkers and I absolutely love it. It was easy to assemble. The seat feels comfortable yet still keeps baby safe.

13-11-2019,Rdasilva,Must have!,My husband and I have gone through a few strollers and this brand by far was our favourite. The colour grey looks so classy and clean.

28-10-2020,J pares,Great Travel system,I love the sensor and it's also a peace of mind too. once you turn the car off automatically makes a sounds so you wont forget the child in the car.

02-05-2019,Gabby,Very sleek and stylish,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love this travel system & so does my son! It so stylish & sleek. I love thr face that you can change the way your child face & so does he. It's beyond awesome thst you cam have the stroller seat sitting up or paying down it's so nice for when my 8 month old wants to nap during walks. I also love love love how spacious the buttom storage is & the zipper that opens up the canopy for better view of baby most strollers only a a very small one this one on the other hand doesn't which is great. Although i absolutely love the stroller there are a few things i think can be improved, the fact that there is only one cup holder is a huge flaw to me I would like it a lot more if there was at least two; one for myself & one for the child. Also the way that it foldeds down is a little confusing to me because you would thin that the handle would be up told when folded & not by the wheels so that you can use the handle to maneuver the stroller. I have not one complaint about the carseat I love it & so does my baby.",2,positive
28-06-2021,ShidanC,,"Excellent quality material and easy to use. You need two hands for most buttons/latches, and even for the one handed release for the carseat it is more difficult than it should be to release both ends of the seat (you have to pull hard with good grip on the release).",2,positive

23-09-2021,KatherineB,Best Purchase We Have Made!,"As a first time mom, I researched for what seems like forever to find the perfect travel system that had everything we were looking for as a new family of three. Almost felt like I was prepping to get a PhD with the numerous hours spent in research. Ironically I started my search with this exact travel system and then compared it to others and all the others I found could not compare in quality, functionality, reviews and price point. We saw this as a huge investment in our child’s safety and also the ability for us to get him out and about into the world in comfort but also style. This was probably the best purchase we have made, setup was super easy and I can’t explain how excited we were when our package quickly arrived in great condition. It’s everything we dreamed of, and we will be buying the Revolve360 car seat for our son to grow with as well. We are Evenflo customers for life. If this is a sign for you to buy this travel system, just know I was looking for signs and I’m so glad I went with my initial gut feeling, this stroller and car seat are a dream come true!",2,positive

With just a push of a button, you can easily convert it from infant seat to toddler mode, or change from front facing to rear facing. Because this stroller has six different modes of use and three different reclining positions, your baby will be riding in complete comfort and luxury, whether lying down or in an upright position. There is plenty of room to carry your baby's necessities in the oversized basket, perfect for an outing at the park, zoo, or a day of shopping. This travel system is attractive, stylish, and very well made. It is lightweight, versatile, and fits easily in the truck of almost any car. It is truly the Cadillac of travel systems! My favorite attributes of this system is the SensorSafe technology. By downloading an app, you can drive safely knowing you will be alerted if your baby becomes unbuckled, or get too warm.

23-08-2020,TLucy,"Light weight, compact and stylish","After viewing multiple strollers, we have decided on the Evenflo Gold SensorSafe Shyft (Moonstone) stroller. I drive a small car and, occasionally, I take public transit also. So it's important that the stroller is lightweight and compact, and this stroller delivered both in a stylish design at a value package. Pros: - Stylish - Quality materials - SensorSafe technology - Durable construction - Lightweight - Compact when collapse for storage/transportation - Large peek-a-boo window and ventilation for toddler seat - Car seat adapter with Load Leg technology Cons: - Toddler/car seat canopy coverage limited; Additional shade flap under canopy would be a plus - Toddler seat does not convert into a full bassinet - Handle bar has a minor wobbling issue and height restrictions - Foam wheels; may not be as effective on gravel and winter conditions - Individual back wheel step lock system - No snack tray for toddler seat Overall, I am fairly satisfied with the purchase and still think that it’s a good value in comparison to other brands. Furthermore, if the above CONS items can be incorporated into future design and package it at a competitive price, I believe this would put Evenflo above many of it's competitors.",2,positive

22-04-2019,Alicia,Feels very well made,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really like this travel system, but it's definitely not for anyone who needs a lightweight, compact set. It feels extremely well made, but that also means kind of heavy. Currently using the stroller for my toddler, and while it is very smooth, it's pretty large for the back of my hatchback. I love being able to either face him toward me or out, and the large area underneath is great for small grocery trips. It is kind of a narrow seat for a toddler, but he seems really comfortable in it. I just worry with a few growth spurts that it will be too narrow for him to sit comfortably. For use with the infant seat or with a smaller child, I'm sure this isn't an issue. The elastic loops that hold the shoulder/neck pads to the buckle is GENIUS. I never knew I needed that feature on my life until now. The infant car seat is great, the technology is very advanced and seems like a solid seat. The way that you can adjust the waist portion of the harness is fantastic. I love the sensorsafe technology, it's just that little extra peace of mind when you have a little one. I can't yet say how well it fits a newborn, so I look forward to finding that out. If space in your vehicle isn't a concern, this travel system is unbelievable! It's sleek, modern and extremely easy to put together and use.",2,positive
29-04-2019,dbates,Simply User-Friendly,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After a couple seconds of 'oh my goodness, look at all the parts' when I opened the box, I have almost instantly come to adore this product! And really, it only took me five minutes to put together, so don't freak out! This stroller is SUPER lightweight and easy to maneuver. The wheels are a soft rubber that just seems to lightly bump over stuff in the road. It's just comfortable to push, I don't feel like I'm having to exert a ton of effort just to push the stroller. The bottom catch-all is huge and roomy, and as a mama that wants to carry everything, it's wonderfully helpful! The seats are extremely simple and quick to interchange. The stroller folds into 1/3 of itself, so storing it will not be a hassle (who has a ton of extra room to store a huge stroller?!). I really like that I can put either seat facing me or facing forward. I have a toddler, so the toddler seat is what I will be using. I conside the bassinet-style feature a very happy bonus, and I really like how the footrest can be adjusted. The stroller bar is awesome, and I'm very thankful that this was considered as an additional feature! I'm loving this stroller, and I'm looking forward to when I can fully utilize all of the bells and whistles! It's elegant, it's easy to use, it's extremely versatile, and it's utterly practical! Evenflo Shyft for the win!",2,positive
19-09-2022,AshleyS,Good stroller at reasonable price point with some flaws,"Overall, this is a nice stroller set for a reasonable price point, which is what we were looking for. The infant car seat is padded and comfortable for our baby. The stroller is easy to put together and easy to fold up for storage. After about 2 months of use, I have found a few cons that I didn’t think about when purchasing, but do impact day-to-day use. 1. The canopy on the infant carrier does not extend far enough to even cover your baby’s face. With our summer baby, it was very difficult to get adequate sun coverage, and I am constantly worried about where the sun is hitting him. It should most definitely be made longer. 2. The car seat is pretty bulky. It fits in our small SUV, but I do have to bring the passenger seat in front all the way forward to fit the car seat. 3. There is no rhyme or reason to which Evenflo carriers and strollers and bases are compatible with each other. For example, we thought about buying one of their jogging strollers, but it was not compatible with the carrier. We also looked at getting their lighter infant carrier (big baby!) but it’s not compatible with our stroller frame. It would be nice if they were more interchangeable, since they click right into place. We do enjoy the stroller set, it looks nice, we’ve gotten a ton of compliments. But those few things would make me get a different set in the future.",2,positive
29-04-2019,Theresa Ann,You'll ask yourself how did i live without this!!!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have three kids (a set of twins is part of this mix) we have had a lot of strollers. This system is incredible. The box is heavy, just a heads up! The base is strong and steady. It has a fabulous easy to understand color system so you know the base is in the car safely. The bucket is so light wight, and easy to hold with your little one strapped in. To clean the shell of the inside of the carseat is a snap, just a little wipe and it's all gone, my daughter got really really sick in the bucket (just wasn't feeling well) and it was so simple to clean it out, i didn't feel that anything leaked into the parts i couldn't clean. I'm OBSESSED with the stroller. To click in the wheels to me less then a minute and it was up and going. I loved how easily the bucket snapped in, and how even easier the seat snapped in. It will face both ways towards the streets or at the person who is pushing the stroller. I will say that for break down to store in your car or home you just simply pull two gray tabs towards you and it folds in half. IF the seat is facing out you can keep it connected. If you have the seat facing the person pushing the stroller i wasn't able to fold down. The bottom of the stroller is amazing at holding bags and easy to get to. I no longer need to weight down the bars of the stroller worried the entire thing is going to flip over. THIS IS A MAJOR WIN FOR ME!!!! Also the handy cup holder is just another win!",2,positive
12-05-2019,DowneastMum84,A must have for any parent out there,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This evenflo travel system comes with the stroller, car seat and the base for the car seat while using in the car. The stroller was easy to set up and took about 20 minutes and comes with a detachable cup holder that attaches to the stroller. The under carriage basket is open at both ends making it wider and more open, I love this feature as if one has a bigger item and doesn't want to bend it the undercarriage basket is big enough to safely store it, This travel system is light weight and compact for easy storage and or travel. it is a very smooth ride for both baby and parent and the wheels seem to go with no issues so far. The stroller alone has so many different positions and is made so it can be used on two little ones at once or just one with no extra tools just the stroller and seat if needed . The car seat has a smart sensor which is clipped in front of the childs chest when buckled in and an app is needed which can be downloaded by the parent and or guardian on their phone that will allow one to get real live updates sent directly from the smart sensor. It can tell you things and alert you when the child has been unbuckled, their well being if the baby has no moved or become still and if the little one has become too warm an alert will be sent, Pros: Larger wider basket Smart sensor Removable cup holder Cons No top storage basket for drinks and or phones No cup holder for little ones Harness straps always seem to slide off",2,positive
27-04-2019,Dani FTM,Super sleek and easy to use!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this stroller! It's perfect for my 1 year old.. I think the way the stroller folds is super easy and I am always on the go, so it's a must for me that I'm able to fold the stroller quickly and put in the back of my SUV. I love that it has 2 breaks because there's no such thing has been extra safe with the kiddos! We use the cup holder all the time, either for her water bottle or mine. The basket's size is VERY appreciated. I run errands a lot with my daughter and having a place to put our bags is a must when using a stroller. I love that this shade has a way of expanding itself to give the baby more shade and also keep the air circulating through the mesh it opens up in the back. People are always asking me about this stroller and their jaws drop when they realize it's not an expensive stroller, but it's such good quality. I love the carseat, she'll outgrow it very soon and we don't necessarily use the travel system anymore unless she really needs a nap and we have to get out of the car no matter what.. but i still love it. The safety feature is awesome! I think I would have loved having this carseat when she was a newborn because as a first time mom I was a bit nervous about car rides and having that extra reassurance that the baby is securely placed in the carseat would have been great! I love that you can have the seat facing forward or backward because depending on where you are, how old your baby is, etc - you can decide where you want the baby to be facing toward. Overall, I love it! :) would definitely recommend.",2,positive
28-04-2019,KarBear,Amazing Travel System!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Well to begin, I love this travel system. It is such good quality and feels very well made. When using it I feel like my child is safe and secure and I have peace of mind. With the car seat it is easy to use, with a nice one touch adjustment which with an infant makes life 10 times easier. It’s easy to clean, and the sensor safe system is really nice to have. It makes our drives stress free as I don’t have to worry about my baby in the backseat. I also love how easy it is to install into the car. The only thing I would say I dislike is the fact that the sensor safe buckle can be hard to unbuckle at first but after using it for a while now it has seemed to get easier to unbuckle. Now let’s move on to the stroller, this stroller is one of the best strollers I have ever used. I love the different ways that you can change it to use it with any child. The bassinet mode is amazing and so easy to do. It’s so simple to change it into whichever mode you want to use and to even change it to forward or rear facing. Then when you want you can remove it with a simple click and use the car seat instead. I am so in love with this system and it’s amazing quality. The one thing that REALLY excites me is the incredible amount of storage you get in the stroller and the fact that it is still completely accessible with any placement of the car seat or stroller seat. This detail is hard to come by with strollers, especially once you attach the car seat to it. I definitely would suggest it to any of my parent friends. The only issue I had was the price of the product, after receiving it and using it I can see that you definitely get what you pay for. With this you are getting a quality stroller with excellent and easy to use qualities.",2,positive
26-04-2019,MOMof3MMM,Great Product!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received my Evenflo Gold stroller with car seat and base and let me say she is a beauty! The packaging is also great very compact and EASY to assemble! I put the stroller together within in 5 minutes or less! I have been using it nonstop to run errands, park, sporting events and shopping! The bottom basket hold so much, it’s like a mini shopping cart/wagon! Even with a full basket and baby in the stroller it moved beautifully without a struggle! It’s easy to convert for baby seat to the big girl seat without an issue the buttons are smooth and easy to press to switch seats! The price point on this item is also great because you are definitely getting a high end stroller for a very reasonable price which I am not complaining! Thank you Evenflo this is what parents need a great product that works and has a good price! So with the gold edition you have the option to download the app to be notified if baby unbuckles the car seat and it’s a wonderful feature! For testing purposes we were driving in a parking lot and my husband unbuckled it and the app immediately notified us that it was no longer connected so that gave us a great peace of mind knowing we will know if something is happening in the back seat! This stroller maneuver beautifully and the overall look is great! I also really enjoy the sunshade feature where you unzip the shade and gives the baby more shade and allows air to flow with the mesh. Another great feature is that you can face the seat foward or backwards. Also the big seat turns into a bassinet so perfect for when baby is asleep you convert it into a bed and continue your day. VERY EASY TO CLEAN AS WELL! The only con for me is that the stroller doesn’t have an SPF just to help combat the sun rays but other then that it has been a smooth ride for us!",2,positive
10-05-2019,HeyHy,So Dreamy!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this travel system but more specifically the stroller. Not only does it look great but it’s extremely sturdy, lightweight, rolls smoothly, and super easy to use. Folding and unfolding this stroller is drastically easier than ones I’ve had in the past, I’m talking more expensive, “higher end” brands. For once I don’t have to fight to get my stroller folded and into my trunk. That’s a huge plus! Also, I can’t express enough how much I love the recline feature on the seat. I can put my baby in the seat upright and go about our day and when he knocks out for a nap I can simply recline his seat to the second or even laying down position without him noticing or being disturbed. I’d say the only downfall I found would be that awful cup holder on the side. It swivels and falls off super easily. It’s really pointless and was just a bad idea. I don’t know who thought a swiveling cup holder was a good idea but I don’t see them winning any awards with that one. We added our stroller organizer to the handlebar and problem solved, 2 cup holders, easily accessible and they’re not going anywhere. I just wish they would’ve added a child tray to attach to the seat. Or at least the option to purchase separately. Also, a Buddy Board, please add a compatible Buddy Board that I can buy for this! The storage basket underneath is super roomy and easily accessible. My three year old just hops right in there when he’s tired of walking and baby is in the seat. (Which is why I really need that Buddy Board!) The accompanying infant seat is equally as great, SUPER easy to install, unlike my previous infants seats. I like the sensor safe feature. My little one doesn’t know how to unbuckle himself but it’s still nice to have that peace of mind. Overall, I’m super pleased with this travel system. It really is just dreamy and I’m very pleased with it.",2,positive
26-05-2021,CarrieB,"Don't pay more for less - ""high end"" products not better than this!","I am PICKY. I looked at EVERY stroller from anywhere I could find that sold them. I wasn't happy with my 1st stroller because I'm petite and the seat was too heavy for me to carry. Any ""high end"" models I saw this time around were heavy to maneuver and SO uncomfortable to grip! It's like they don't know how hands go. And what's with all of the extra brackets and pieces for attaching and changing to toddler seats....no thanks. The second I moved this from it's spot I knew it was the right one. SO EASY, so smooth, REALLY comfortable to hold and guess what...when you want to put the seat in it you....put it in. OH OH and when you change to the toddler seat from the baby car seat you know what you have to do to make it 'compatible'? NOTHING. You - that's right - just put it in. AND it reclines which is a huge feature for your napping little one when you're out. I LOVE the fact that you can put stuff in the bottom from the front OR the back. No more hunkering down to try to reach way under and grab a bag (did I mention how big the storage underneath is too??) Lightest baby seat I've every picked up. Does it have rubber wheels? No. Sure that would be great for gravel traction if you walk nature paths but other than that, pumping up the air all the time is a pain anyway. Only 2 downsides - ONE cup holder screwed into the side. Still, a lot of strollers haven't adjusted the size ANYWAY and they're too small so I had to get a little organizer before and don't mind doing it again or using another cup holder accessory that clips on. 2nd is that there's no nice snack tray for the toddler seat. You can buy one as an accessory but the reviews say it's WAY too high for a kid to even reach. Hopefully they fix this issue soon or you can find aftermarket trays. All in all, not enough for me to not LOVE this purchase. SO easy, so light, nicely padded...quality product.",2,positive
29-04-2019,JustAMom,So many options to configure!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This travel system has been a great addition to our household. The infant car seat was very easy to install and feels highly secure. The buckles and straps are easy to maneuver despite my baby’s best efforts to turn, pull, roll, go stiff as a board, etc etc. Once in, baby seems comfortable and content. The materials feel soft and high quality but also durable. Spills and spit up seem to wipe up clean without residue- maybe it has some stain resistant features? When carrying the seat and baby, it doesn’t feel overly heavy but it’s not flimsy either. Moving on to the stroller, the same soft, high quality material is used for the HUGE storage basket and the large adjustable sun shade. The wheels are super smooth and large enough to glide across high grass or uneven terrain with ease. Wheel locks on each side are easy to click with your foot. The height of the push bar is really confortable for myself (5’4”) and my partner at over 6’. Soft padded handle bar and the drink holder is a nice feature. The car seat clicks into the stroller with ease and works great to avoid interrupting a nap, but I absolutely love the additional seat for the stroller (same awesome material) and the different ways you can position it- facing out or toward you, lay flat like a bassinet, upright with legs straight out, or upright with legs bent at the knee. The five point restraint has soft padding and the clasp is easy to open or close with one hand. This seat also comfortably fits either my 9 month old or my 3 year old, making it at great option to grow with your family. I think it has a high weight limit as well. The stroller folds for storage a little larger than some other models but it’s not extremely heavy and I can still easily fit it in my smaller SUV. It doesn’t deter me from wanting to use it at any opportunity. It has an intuitive lock feature to keep the stroller from snapping open until you want it to. Overall, excellent piece of baby and child gear. Buy it!",2,positive
15-04-2020,TiltShift,Performs like premium brands at reasonable price,"We did an extensive amount of research before purchasing this stroller for our firstborn. We wanted a travel system at an affordable price. We had actually landed on the Evenflo Pivot Modular Travel System (previous generation to this Gold Shyft) but returned it in exchange for the Gold Shyft for two main reasons: 1. Pivot carseat does not click into stroller as smoothly and as intuitively as the Gold Shyft does (it was annoying trying it even at the store); 2. Fear of Pivot front wheels locking in the future as warned by online reviews. What we DID LOVE about the Pivot that the Gold Shyft didn't have was the bassinet/pram/lay full-flat feature that the Pivot had. I loved the look of the Pivot in the bassinet mode. Pivot seemed larger and wider too, allowing for more space for baby to grow into. I would say that that difference would be the biggest downside to the Gold Shyft, as pediatricians recommend not keeping baby in a carseat for long periods of time due to spine formation (and instead lay newborns down on flat surface). Another thing is that the about 9 months has passed since the manufacture date on the carseat, shortening the time we have until the carseat expires :/. Regardless, there are so many things to love about this Gold Shyft stroller. We love that it is light, has a sleek design, large space for storage, good value, and can stand up on its own folded resulting in a smaller footprint. Not many affordable strollers can do this! We are shocked that we don't see more of this stroller out on the streets! Looking forward to using it when baby arrives in 6 weeks. I searched high and low on the internet for an online review that compared the old Pivot Travel Modular System and the new Gold Shyft Modular System to no avail. We instead had to bring both strollers home and open the boxes to come to the conclusion of keeping the Gold Shyft in the grey colour (our only option at Babies R Us Canada :)). I hope you find this helpful! Good luck parents!",2,positive
29-04-2019,crystalpogo1,Perfect travel system that grows with your family!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This travel system is super sleek, safe and versatile and will last while you grow your family. With a lifetime warranty to boot! Car Seat Base: Has storage for the latch straps and a level to make sure you have it at the proper recline. Lots of pictures with directions to make sure you have it secured properly. Infant Car Seat: Locks and releases easily into the car seat base. Removable infant insert to provide extra padding for your squish! It’s nice and thick and comes out easily as well. The chest straps have removable covers to protect your little ones neck. The harness adjusts easily up and down. The canopy gives a ton of shade from the sun and stays in place. The SensorSafe clip is a game changer for infant seats. It connects to an app on your phone and alerts you if the car temperature is too warm or if your baby gets unbuckled. This feature has relieved so much anxiety that I have when someone else is transporting my baby. I’m always petrified she will be left in the car. Now I make sure that everyone has the app. Total piece of mind! Stroller: Comes almost fully assembled, just had to remove some packaging and attach the wheels. The height of the stroller is amazing! I’m a taller person and the placement of the handle bar is perfect. There is a ton of space for cargo on the bottom that you can get to from the front or back of the stroller. The locks securely stop the wheels from moving. Using the stroller with the infant car seat is super easy, no bulky attachments, just clip the seat in and go. Remove the seat and fold the stroller with one motion. It’s not too bulky yet feels very substantial. The material on the additional stroller seat is high quality. My 17 month old fits in it perfectly and I love that I can recline it fully back for when she’s napping. The option to have the seat face me or away is awesome too. This travel system will easily last from infant to toddlerhood with each child. It’s the first and last and ONLY one you will need.",2,positive
28-05-2019,BrittanyTH,Great system!,This travel system has all of the features I found myself wanting with my first child’s stroller. All of the features and accessories are of the highest quality and works without any hiccups. Car seat: The material is comfortable and even feels padded. The black color is easy to clean and will hide stains well. Adjustment of the straps is extremely easy. There is no unhooking. All you need to do is push a button on the top of the car seat and slide to adjust the height of the shoulder straps. The clip in the center of the chest is actually a sensor that works with another sensor you plug into your car to monitor the temperature inside your car and whether the seat is bucked properly. All buckles on the car seat are easy to use and can be done with just one hand. The base is extremely easy to install and has levels with differing colors to aid you in getting the proper recline based on the child’s weight. It also has a very secure and easy to use way to install the car seat base using a lap belt instead of the latch system. Stroller: The stroller moves very smooth and the brakes are easy to use and secure. The bottom basket of the stroller is very roomy. There are several places on the stroller to attach accessories such as cupholders. The actual stroller portion can be used in many different ways. It can be laid completely back and completely upright and even in between. It could work perfectly for a newborn all the way up to an older toddler. The buckles are secure and easy to use. The stroller included a detachable bumper bar. The stroller sits all the way up so an older child will be able to see everything. You can even face the stroller and car seat both ways when you attach it to the frame. The frame is very easy to fold and does not take up much room when you store it because it is separate from the stroller attachment. We love this stroller and it works very well for our toddler. We will be using this for our second child too! I cannot even think of any features that I would add to this stroller or car seat because they are perfect.,2,positive
